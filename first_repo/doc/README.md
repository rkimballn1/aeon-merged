# Documentation

Documentation is available at [aeon.nervanasys.com](http://aeon.nervanasys.com)
Files in this directory are not meant to serve as github documentation as they
use Sphinx custom directives for reStructuredText implementation.
To compile documentation, install prerequisites with ``./install_prereqs``. It uses ``apt``, so you need to modify it if you don't work on Ubuntu. After that, run ``make doc html`` for html documentation.
